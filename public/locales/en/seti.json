      "2_3": "In the case of the 2 publicity free-action corner, you gain only 1 publicity for showing such a card.",
      "5_1": "You need to resolve the movement before checking whether you have a probe on a space adjacent to Earth.",
      "7_1": "The card's mission requires you to have 2 probes in space at once (not turned into a lander, nor an orbiter), each of them on a space with a different planet (Earth does not count in this case).",
      "8_1": "A data pool is the space in the left part of your player board that can hold up to 6 data. Data placed in your computer do not count for this effect.",
      "10_1": "Note that the publicity track goes only up to 10. So if you do not have 0 publicity when playing this card, all the excess publicity that goes over 10 will be lost.",
      "12_1": "\"Visiting a planet\" means that you need to move to a space with the planet. Simply being on a planet when you play this card does not count – you would need to leave that space and then return to it, and that would count only as one of the two different planets.",
      "12_2": "The effect lasts for the whole turn, so you can gain the benefit also with the additional moves performed as free actions after evaluating this card.",
      "13_1": "You do not pay the base cost of the Scan action but you still need to pay the additional costs of your purple techs if you decide to use them.",
      "13_2": "Note that you gain the signal token only after resolving the scan action, so the token cannot be used during that same scan action.",
      "15_1": "For example, if the tech tile has the [1 energy] immediate bonus printed on it, you gain it once for acquiring the tile and then again thanks to the card's effect.",
      "15_2": "The card's effect doesn't apply to the extra immediate bonuses that two of the tech tiles grant: [probe launch] and [2 data].",
      "16_1": "Note that you first need to resolve the card's main effect before you can check the mission condition. So if you would have 0 publicity when playing the card, you won't be able to complete its mission right away, because you first gain the 4 publicity from the main effect.",
      "17_1": "You can theoretically play the card even for 0 credits. You won't gain anything from it, so it could only make sense for timing reasons.",
      "17_2": "Note that the publicity track only goes up to 10. While you can spend more than 5 credits when playing this card, any excess publicity will be lost. However, you will still earn 2 points for each additional credit you spend.",
      "18_1": "You can play this card even when you have 0 publicity and still gain the tech. That is actually the most effective way to do it.",
      "19_1": "When you remove the orbiter from the 1st space (with the extra 3-points reward) that space becomes available again. This applies also when there are multiple orbiters around that planet's orbit – they do not slide when the 1st space gets empty, so the next time someone orbits the planet, they gain those 3 points.",
      "19_2": "Placing a probe on the planet doesn't count as a launch. Neither does it count as a visit, which means you do not gain the publicity for visiting that planet either.",
      "19_3": "The card allows you to exceed your limit of probes in space. But the limit still applies for your regular launches so to launch another probe you will probably need to get rid of those you have in space first (usually turning them into an orbiter or lander).",

      "34_1": "The first effect allows you to increase your income. To do this, tuck another card from your hand for income and immediately gain its income resource.",
      "34_2": "For the second effect, determine which tech type you have the most of (probe, telescope, or computer techs). Then draw 1 random card for each tech tile of that color.",
      "35_1": "Both the data in your data pool and the data placed in your computer count toward the mission condition. This means that without any computer tech, you would need to fill both your entire data pool and all six spaces in your computer.",
